It is based on its existing server-side code (REST API and database), with supporting documentation.\nKey Features\n○ The app should display a welcome view where users will be able to either log in or register an account. \n○ Once authenticated, the user should now view all movies. \n○ Upon clicking on a particular movie, users will be taken to a single movie view, where additional movie details will be displayed. \n○ The single movie view will contain the following additional features: \n   ○ A button that when clicked takes a user to the director view, where details about the director of that particular movie will be displayed. \n   ○ A button that when clicked takes a user to the genre view, where details about that particular genre of the movie will be displayed. \nDevelopment server\nRun ng serve for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.\nCode scaffolding\nRun ng generate component component-name to generate a new component. You can also use ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module.\nBuild\nRun ng build to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the dist/ directory.\nRunning unit tests\nRun ng test to execute the unit tests via Karma.\nRunning end-to-end tests\nRun ng e2e to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.\nFurther help\nTo get more help on the Angular CLI use ng help or go check out the Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                   \n    \n         results matching \"\"\n        \n    \n    \n        No results matching \"\"\n    \n\n"},"modules.html":{"url":"modules.html","title":"modules -
